# Maat v2.2.0

Welcome to **M**y **A**n**A**lysis **T**ools; or just **Maat**, as the Egyptian goddess of truth, order, and justice.  

Just as an egyptian goddess fallen from the sky, this Python package makes my life easier when analyzing INS, FTIR and Raman CSV data files, among others.
Bear in mind that, as any egyptian god, Maat is not perfect and may be full of bugs. Please report any issues you may find.  


## Installation

Install the required dependencies by running:  
```shell
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy
```
